What could be done with more time:
- Take Location as input from user (similar to [Angular SPA Weather App](http://shoaibkhan.in/spa/#/))
- Read current location using HTML5 Geolocation api
- Take number of days (currently fixed at 5 days) to forecast weather as input from user (similar to [Angular SPA Weather App](http://shoaibkhan.in/spa/#/))
